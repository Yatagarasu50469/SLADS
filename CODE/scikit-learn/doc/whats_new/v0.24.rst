Put the changes in their relevant module.

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.ensemble`
.......................

- |Feature| :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` and
  :class:`ensemble.HistGradientClassifier` now support `staged_predict`,
  which allows monitoring of each stage.
  :pr:`16985` by :user:`Hao Chun Chang <haochunchang>`.

:mod:`sklearn.impute`
.....................

- |Fix| replace the default values in :class:`impute.IterativeImputer`
  of `min_value` and `max_value` parameters to `-np.inf` and `np.inf`,
  respectively instead of `None`. However, the behaviour of the class does not
  change since `None` was defaulting to these values already.
  :pr:`16493` by :user:`Darshan N <DarshanGowda0>`.

:mod:`sklearn.model_selection`
..............................

- |Enhancement| :class:`model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit` has two new keyword
  arguments `test_size` and `gap`. `test_size` allows the out-of-sample
  time series length to be fixed for all folds. `gap` removes a fixed number of
  samples between the train and test set on each fold.
  :pr:`13204` by :user:`Kyle Kosic <kykosic>`.

- |Feature| A new parameter `importance_getter` was added to
  :class:`feature_selection.RFE`, :class:`feature_selection.RFECV` and
  :class:`feature_selection.SelectFromModel`, allowing the user to specify an
  attribute name/path or a `callable` for extracting feature importance from
  the estimator.  :pr:`15361` by :user:`Venkatachalam N <venkyyuvy>`

  
:mod:`sklearn.tree`
...................

- |Enhancement| :func:`tree.plot_tree` now uses colors from the matplotlib
  configuration settings. :pr:`17187` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.
